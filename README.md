# Breast-Cancer-Detection
# Breast Cancer Tumor Classification Project

## Project Summary

This project involves analyzing and classifying breast cancer tumors using machine learning techniques, leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. The dataset includes 32 features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The objective is to classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) and to evaluate the performance of various classification models.

## Project Overview
**Modeling and Evaluation with Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Train the Decision Tree Classifier on the training set.
   - Visualize the confusion matrix.
**Modeling and Evaluation with Support Vector Machine (RBF) Classifier**
   - Train the SVM (RBF) Classifier on the training set.
   - Visualize the confusion matrix.

**Modeling and Evaluation with Support Vector Machine (Polynomial) Classifier** *(if applicable)*
   - Train the SVM (Polynomial) Classifier on the training set.

**Feature Importance and Model Optimization with Random Forest Method**
   - Determine feature importance using the Random Forest method.
